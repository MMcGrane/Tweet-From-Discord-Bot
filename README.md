# Tweet-From-Discord-Bot
A bot that allows you to make tweets using Discord!

# How To Use
To use this bot you must register your Twitter account as a developer account, then you should be able to create a bot and get access to the tokens you need.
I have put comments that indicate where you need to put these tokens.

Next, you need to create a Discord Bot in the Discord Developer Portal, once you've done this you should be able to get the token for your bot and you can then insert it into the code.

After all of this is done, you can now run the bot and make tweets from Discord using the "!tweet" command!
